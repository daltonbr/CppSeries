# CppSeries

These are my personal notes and codes from an awesome [C++ Series by TheCherno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18c3MTX0PK0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb)

## Topics & Videos

* [Pointers in C++](016-Pointers/Pointers.md)
* [References in C++](017-References/References.md)
* [Classes](018-Classes/Classes.md) (and a little bit of Structs)
* [Static in C++](021-Static/Static.md)
  * Inside and outside of Classes/Structs
* [Enums](024-Enums/Enums.md)

The number on the folders are the index of the videos on the Youtube Playlist, not every folder have a Visual Studio project, most of the time I just take some notes.
